    "1. Customer Prioritization Strategy Adopting a tiered approach allows us to focus resources where they matter most:\n",
    "   - Priority 1: The \"Red Alert\" Group (True Positives, ~360 users)Profile: \"Classic Churners\" (high bills, month-to-month contracts).\n",
    "       - Why: They are the \"low-hanging fruit\" and the model is highly confident they will leave.\n",
    "    - Priority 2: The \"Silent Risk\" Group (False Negatives, ~200 users)Profile: Look safe (long tenure) but are leaving anyway.Why: These are dangerous \"silent killers\" leaving due to service failures or unseen competitor offers.\n",
    "    - Priority 3: The \"Loyal but Risky\" Group (False Positives, ~260 users)Profile: \"Sticky\" customers who look like churners but stay.Why: They are candidates for upselling, not saving.\n",
    "2. Recommended Actions by Segment Target Group StrategyS pecific Action\n",
    "   - True Positives Aggressive Retention: Offer \"Lock-in Discounts\" (e.g., 15% off for a 1-year contract) via fast channels like SMS or Push notifications.\n",
    "   - Silent Risks Service Recovery: Implement \"VIP Health Checks.\" Focus on fixing bad experiences rather than price.\n",
    "   - Trigger immediate manager calls for low-rated support tickets.\n",
    "   - False Positives Cost Optimization: Stop wasting retention budget. If usage is high, do nothing or attempt to upsell, as they have proven they won't leave easily.\n",
    "   - True Negatives : Relationship Maintenance\"Do No Harm.\" Acknowledge loyalty quietly (e.g., \"Thanks for 3 years\") but avoid \"Please stay\" emails that might trigger them to rethink their contract.\n",
    "\n",
    "Summary:\n",
    "---\n",
    "- Prioritise high-risk, high-value customers for retention.\n",
    "- Improve onboarding and early engagement strategies.\n",
    "- Encourage long-term contracts and value-added services.\n",
    "- Use targeted incentives for month-to-month customers."
